### 📂 File Name: `ddos.py` - Destroyer Denial of Service Script

### 🌟 Overview

🛡️ **Destroyer Denial of Service (DDoS) Script**: This is a straightforward yet potent tool designed exclusively for educational purposes. It orchestrates a Denial of Service (DoS) attack on a designated IP address and port, inundating it with TCP packets. The script harnesses the power of Python's asyncio and multiprocessing libraries for enhanced efficiency. Always deploy this script judiciously, ensuring its use is confined to networks or systems where you possess explicit permission.

### 🛠️ Features

- 🎯 Inundate a target IP address with TCP packets.
- 🚀 Employ asyncio for asynchronous packet transmission.
- 🔄 Utilize multiprocessing to execute multiple script instances concurrently.

### 🚀 Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Destroyer-official/Destroyer-DoS.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the directory:**
    ```bash
