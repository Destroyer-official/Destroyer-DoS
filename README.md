### 📂 File Name: `ddos.py` - Destroyer Denial of Service Script

### 🌟 Overview

🛡️ **Destroyer Denial of Service (DDoS) Script**: A powerful educational tool designed to simulate a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Orchestrates an assault on a specified IP and port, unleashing a barrage of TCP packets. Utilizes Python's asyncio and multiprocessing for maximum impact. Deploy responsibly in authorized environments.

### 🛠️ Features

- 🎯 Flood a target IP with TCP packets.
- 🚀 Utilize asyncio for asynchronous packet transmission.
- 🔄 Leverage multiprocessing for concurrent execution.

### 🚀 Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Destroyer-official/Destroyer-DoS.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Destroyer-DoS
    ```

3. **📦 Install the required packages:**
    ```
    Required modules are part of the Python standard library and usually included with Python installations. No separate installation is needed.

    Module included in the standard library:
       - socket
       - random
       - multiprocessing
       - argparse (since Python 3.2)

    Module that might need installation:
       - asyncio (included in Python 3.4 and later, might need installation for older Python versions)
    ```

    For Python versions lower than 3.4.0:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **✨ Execute the script using command-line arguments:**
    ```bash
    python ddos.py --ip [Target_IP] --p [Target_Port] --processes [Number_of_Processes] --threads [Number_of_Threads]
    ```

### 💻 Command-Line Arguments

- `--ip`: Specify the target IP address.
- `--p`: Define the target port number.
- `--processes`: Set the number of processes to run concurrently (default: 10).
- `--threads`: Define the number of threads per process (default: 50).
